# Original
A food app variant written in C++. Intented to be ran on 1 computer--locally; no fancy server magic.

# How to use
Run `./run.sh` to build and compile. 
Support for amounts, groups, names, and dates.

* Amounts can be used for a 4 or 8-pack of something; if the item is only in a case of 1, pass 1 as the amount.
* Groups can be used for shelves or locations of food items.
* Dates are sorted by default at `list items`.

# Still under development!
I know, it ain't pretty, but it has some work needed.
