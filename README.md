# Expiration date tracker
Originally made to keep teack of expiration
dates and warn you if an item is about to expire!

# How To Use

Run ./run.sh at the terminal to compile then execute.
It is entirely text-based and in C++ (as it should be.)

Support for date sorting, adding items, removing items,
even sections, statuses, etc.

# Sorry if the code isn't clean.

It's not too easy to keep C++ string functions easy to
read, but you get the idea.

And no, I don't care if you use it. No copyright laws will
sentence you to prison (hopefully).
